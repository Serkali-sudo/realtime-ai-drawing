## Requirements
* An API key from [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/)
* Minimum API:  Android 5.1 (21)

## Features
* Transform drawings to ai art using  **Optimized Latent Consistency (SDv1.5)**
* It is realtime so you can see the result immediately after each stroke
* Change aspect ratio of the canvas
* Auto save every image generated
* Upscale images using ai models like: **RealESRGAN**

## How to use
* Get an API key from [fal.ai](https://fal.ai/)
* Enter the API key to the app from settings or it will prompt when you try to run or at start of the app if you havent entered an api key
* Write a prompt then start drawing

Video below uses random seed but the app uses a spesific seed for every image by default for consistency.
